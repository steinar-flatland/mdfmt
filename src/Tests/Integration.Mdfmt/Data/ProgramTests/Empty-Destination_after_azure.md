## 1. Introduction

This test proves that if a destination is empty, Mdfmt will try to fill it in by matching it to a heading.

To read about cool stuff go to section [2. Cool Stuff](./file.md#2.-cool-stuff).

To read about enigmatic stuff go to section [3. Enigmatic Stuff](./file.md#3.-enigmatic-stuff).

Try as we might, this link cannot be resolved:  [Nonexistent Stuff]().  It will remain with an empty destination.

## 2. Cool Stuff

This is a section on cool stuff.

## 3. Enigmatic Stuff

This is a section on Enigmatic Stuff.

## 4. Conclusion

That's all.
