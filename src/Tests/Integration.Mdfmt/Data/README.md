# README

The `Data` folder has test data to support testing.

It is important to provide the data in ProgramTests.zip in a zipped form, because some the tests
rely on specific newline characters (`\n` vs `"\r\n"`), and newline characters can change when
checking in and out of repositories, which could mess up the test data.
