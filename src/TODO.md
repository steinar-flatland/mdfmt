# TODO

Some immediate TODOs of a techncial nature.

- [ ] Resolve warnings on compiled RegExes
- [ ] Check around and increase use of read only collections where it makes sense?
- [ ] I believe we can eliminate the HeadingsLoader, by adding a Headings property to the Regions model.  This model has all the information that is needed.  This will reduce I/O during a run.
